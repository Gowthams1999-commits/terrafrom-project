# Modules in terraform.

Modules: Instead of writing configuration files repeatedly, we can use modules to create resources in any cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP). We can pass values as parameters into the modules, allowing us to avoid modifying the core logic of the code. The module code is stored in a different path, separate from your main configuration

## Key Benefits of Using Modules in Terraform:

### Reusability: 

Once you've created a module, you can reuse it across different projects or environments. This avoids code duplication, and if you need to make changes, you only need to update the module, not every instance where it's used.

### Maintainability:
By organizing your Terraform configurations into modules, you can keep your code clean and well-structured. This also helps to prevent errors since the logic is centralized in one place.

### Parameterization:
You can define input variables for your module, making it flexible. By passing values as parameters, you can customize the module's behavior for different environments or use cases.

### Standardization: 
With modules, you can enforce best practices and ensure that all your teams or projects use the same configuration patterns. This makes managing large-scale infrastructure more consistent.
