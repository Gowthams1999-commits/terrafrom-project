# Modules in terraform.

Modules: write configuration file again and again. we can use module to create a resources in any cloud provider ( AWS or Azure or GCP ). We can pass values as perametor in modules instead of touching you logical code. your local code is created in different path.

## Key Benefits of Using Modules in Terraform:

### Reusability: 

Once you've created a module, you can reuse it across different projects or environments. This avoids code duplication, and if you need to make changes, you only need to update the module, not every instance where it's used.

### Maintainability:
By organizing your Terraform configurations into modules, you can keep your code clean and well-structured. This also helps to prevent errors since the logic is centralized in one place.

### Parameterization:
You can define input variables for your module, making it flexible. By passing values as parameters, you can customize the module's behavior for different environments or use cases.

### Standardization: 
With modules, you can enforce best practices and ensure that all your teams or projects use the same configuration patterns. This makes managing large-scale infrastructure more consistent.
