# Terraform state file and Remote backend.

## Create a bucket and dynamdb for remote backend and enable state lock

## in Terraform version 1.10.X we can avoid dynamdb for enable state lock instead we can use use_lockfile = true parameters.

## what is differente between -migrate-state and reconfigure.

ðŸ”¹ 1. -migrate-state

ðŸ‘‰ Purpose: Moves your existing state from the old backend to the new backend.

Example:

Initially, your state is local (terraform.tfstate file).

You change backend config to S3.

Run:

terraform init -migrate-state

Terraform will upload your existing state file into the new backend (S3).

This way you donâ€™t lose your infrastructure state.

âœ… Use when:

You are switching from local â†’ remote backend.

Or moving from one remote backend â†’ another.

ðŸ”¹ 2. terraform init -reconfigure

ðŸ‘‰ Meaning: Forget old backend settings and use the new ones, but donâ€™t move state.

Example:

You already use an S3 backend:

backend "s3" {
  bucket = "my-terraform-state"
  key    = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
  region = "us-east-1"
}


Now, you change bucket name or region:

backend "s3" {
  bucket = "new-terraform-state"
  key    = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
  region = "us-east-1"
}


Run:

terraform init -reconfigure


Terraform will reinitialize backend with the new config.

It does not move old state automatically (you must handle that if needed).

âœ… Use when backend configuration changed (like new bucket, credentials, or reg
