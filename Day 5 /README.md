# Terraform state file and Remote backend.


The terraform.tfstate file is crucial in Terraform as it stores the current state of your infrastructure. This file contains information about your resources, their attributes, and metadata. Terraform uses this state file to manage your infrastructure and track changes between the desired state (as defined in your Terraform configuration) and the current state (as it exists in the real world).

## Advantages of terraform.tfstate File
## Tracking Resource Changes: 
The terraform.tfstate file stores details of your AWS (or other cloud providers) resources and configuration changes. This allows Terraform to track changes to the resources you define and ensure that they are correctly updated, created, or deleted.

## State Locking: 
Using remote backends like S3 with DynamoDB for state locking helps prevent simultaneous modifications of the state file by different users or processes. This ensures that only one operation happens at a time, avoiding race conditions or conflicts.

## Displaying Configuration Differences: 
Terraform compares the desired configuration (from .tf files) with the actual state (from terraform.tfstate) to determine what changes need to be made. It shows the difference, allowing you to preview changes before applying them.

## Disadvantages of Storing terraform.tfstate in Version Control (VCS)
## Exposure of Sensitive Information: 
The terraform.tfstate file can contain sensitive information like access keys, passwords, or other private data associated with your infrastructure. If stored in a public or improperly secured VCS (like GitHub), this can lead to security risks, as anyone with access to the repository can view or modify the state.

## Conflict Issues: 
If multiple people or systems are modifying the terraform.tfstate file and storing it in VCS, you might encounter merge conflicts. These conflicts occur when different changes are made to the state file, and resolving them manually can be error-prone and risky. Using a remote backend is recommended to handle these issues.
